programdescription = ["""Which world-leading company has taken the step of showing its most important asset - its people - in its financial statements? All HR leaders should understand why the company is exceptional, and how you too could show the value of your people.

This energizing and powerful business acumen session gets rave reviews and will give you: firstly, a fundamental grasp and refresher of financial statements that makes them breathtakingly simple to read. You’ll get deep insight into the nature of business itself. Secondly, you’ll see how you too can reflect the value of your people and increase the return on HR investment.

You’ll use colorful diagrams, highlighters (provided), and even sound effects in this lively interactive session. Suitable for all, including “non-numbers” people, the session is a must for leaders wanting to align their HR department with the financial goals of the business units, as well as improve financial communication in the organization.""","""  - Are you tired of working 50, 60, 70 or more hours a week?
- Do you come in early and stay late, just to get YOUR work done?
- Are you frustrated by what your HR team members – or other managers don’t do or can’t figure out for themselves?""","""Active listening is an essential component of effective professional and personal relationships. This course helps participants become more effective listeners through an in-depth exploration of the skill of active listening to include summarizing, paraphrasing, holding judgment, reflecting, and clarifying. Participants are guided through the differences between hearing and listening as well as the three levels of listening. This program is highly experiential, giving participants an opportunity to thoroughly practice their new or enhanced active listening skills.""","""Organizations are increasingly focusing on using advanced statistical modeling techniques to predict key business outcomes such as attrition, quality of higher, and leadership potential. However, just creating statistical models is not enough. Two critical issues need to be addressed in order for predictive analytics to be a successful investment for an organization. First, we cannot sacrifice on the robustness of the models. When adopting predictive analytics, many organizations make the mistake of oversimplifying the process by running bivariate correlations on a handful of HRIS data fields, often focusing on a single data source, or performing simple psychometric assessments. Unless the organization adopts a more holistic stance by gathering data from different sources and then validate model predictions against actual results, credibility and value from these models will remain questionable. 

The second issue is equally important but perhaps, even more challenging: organizations must actually do something with the results from these models. Organizations need to find a way to integrate results from their predictive modeling efforts into management of talent workflow and start to address the “so what?” question that arises once models are built. Actions derived from predictive findings can have impact on change management, hiring strategies, workforce planning, risk management, and IT integration. This brings a wealth of challenges, but neglecting to act on results eliminates any possibility of having real return on investment of predictive modeling.

Join Ranjan Dutta, leader of the Predictive Analytics practice at PwC, as he shares insights on how successful predictive models are built and most importantly, how organizations have been able to leverage findings from these models to make impactful workforce decision.""","""Many organizations place significant investments into leadership development programs of all shapes and sizes. Yet, very few have well designed mechanisms to know whether these programs are delivering on the expectations of the program’s stakeholders. Which program components are worthwhile and which fall flat? What is getting in the way of allowing leaders to use what they learn? What are champions of the leadership development program doing to make sure it is successful? This session will take you in a deep dive of a case study from an IT consulting firm in the area who instituted a leadership development program for all supervisors to build critical skills necessary to help the company grow. Learn how they implemented a world class evaluation system using the Kirkpatrick New World Model, one of the foremost learning evaluation frameworks. Hear about early results of this evaluation and how it is being used to show impact on the bottom line. Lastly, come learn about best practices and lessons learned that you can implement to enhance your evaluation efforts back at the office.""","""According to a recent study by the Center or Talent Innovation, being perceived as leadership material is essential to being promoted into leadership positions. In fact, the 268 senior executives surveyed said “executive presence” counts for 26% of what it takes to get promoted. So how can you cultivate your executive presence? This lunch time session will give you a primer in everything from Power Poses to Microexpessions in a fun, practical talk by Erin Pitera, a recognized woman entrepreneur and CEO in the DC Metro region.""","""Following the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and subsequent shootings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and five Dallas police officers, companies were struggling with how to respond. These national tragedies depict one, often unexplored, dynamic of corporate America—Trauma and its impact on the workplace. What can companies do to create safe spaces and mechanisms of “support” for employees who feel impacted by these events? To reinforce the intent of "inclusion", having some intentional dialogue around this topic is necessary to include all voices and viewpoints. During this session, we will introduce a methodology to discuss difficult topics around diversity and inclusion within a safe space.

This session, in particular, will provide:

  - A methodology for open dialogue on the recent tragedies; 
  - Coping mechanisms for employees who feel impacted; 
  - Tactics for allies who want to show support and empathy; and 
  - Strategies for leaders to create supportive, inclusive work environments and spaces following tragedies.
 
For employees to do their best work, it is imperative they feel supported in the workplace. HR professionals that understand the connection between productive dialogue and productivity can lead their organizations to success."""]
