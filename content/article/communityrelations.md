### Community Relations

{{< heading "p" "Community Outreach Information and Requests" >}} 

NOVA SHRM is committed to supporting community organizations as a means to give back to the local communities.  Support may be in the form of volunteerism or information sharing through our Chapter events, website, or newsletter. 

The Community Relations Committee and the NOVA SHRM Board of Directors will determine which initiatives, programs, and/or organizations will be supported.

For information about our current community relations programs and/or requests for support  for your organization or agency, please contact Janine Onorio, NOVA SHRM's Community Relations Coordinator at [novashrmcommunityoutreach@gmail.com](mailto:novashrmcommunityoutreach@gmail.com).
