Almost all employees deal with some type of financial stress in their lives. These stressors can range from budgeting and debt issues to the inability to find reliable assistance with important financial decisions. Financial stress affects more than just the personal life of an employee, it can lead to a decline in morale, productivity, as well as health issues and absenteeism. 

This presentation will identify how financial stress can affect an organization, the long term results of untreated employee financial stress and the process of identifying who is most likely to suffer from financial stress (including the key statistics HR has access to that can identify how much financial stress employees are under). This presentation will also provide proactive steps a company can take to help alleviate employee financial stress and identify the role a company’s retirement plan provider can play in the process. 

Human resource professionals are uniquely positioned to help employees deal with financial stress and the attitude of the employer towards the financial state of their employees could make a big difference for the company. While financial stress may be occurring in the personal lives of their employees, the employers can ensure that their employees have the information they need to take care of their finances. Employers can help alleviate stress by encouraging saving, promoting financial education programs, and providing their employees access to experienced financial advisors. If implemented correctly, these types of programs could be the difference between productive employees and those who negatively affect the company's bottom-line.
