As a learning professional and performance consultant, are you an order taker or a business partner? Order takers wait for their stakeholders to knock on the door and ask for training. Business partners are intimately familiar with the mission of the organization and consider learning interventions as a set of strategic choices designed to support that mission. Moving into a business partner role requires taking the initiative to create a powerful learning strategy for your organization. In doing so, you will be able to marshal resources more effectively, to predict mission requirements, and to create a team that is rowing together to achieve a common purpose. 

If you’re ready to take the leap, join us for an interactive session designed to provide you with a four step approach to creating a powerful learning strategy. 
Step 1. How to create a learning philosophy that is aligned with the mission and vision of your organization.
Step 2. How to create long-term goals for your learning function, such as diversifying learning modalities, mapping competencies, identifying competency gaps, and prioritizing learning content.
Step 3. How to identify the necessary human resources (i.e., internal and external staff) and physical infrastructure (i.e., Learning Management Systems, content delivery systems) necessary to accomplish your goals.
Step 4. How to create a thoughtful and actionable implementation plan that includes strategic communications of your strategy to key stakeholders. 

During the session, you will hear stories and examples from real Federal, non-profit, and private sector organizations and learn how to apply those examples in your learning function. You will obtain valuable job aids that you can use with your teams including focus group agendas, strategic planning worksheets, and team checklists. Most importantly, you will network with colleagues facing similar challenges to come up with strategies for building buy in and getting results.
